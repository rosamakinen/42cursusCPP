ðŸš€ Overview ðŸš€
The C++ modules aim give a comprehensive understanding of the C++ programming language and its applications. The modules cover a wide range of topics, from foundational concepts to advanced techniques, through a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and project-based learning.

ðŸ”‘ Key Topics Covered ðŸ”‘
1.Foundations of C++: The modules start with the basics, covering fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, operators, and control structures. This lays the groundwork for more advanced topics.

2.Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): A significant portion of the modules focus on OOP principles in C++. This includes classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Learning how to design and implement robust, modular, and reusable code using these concepts.

3.Memory Management: Memory management is crucial in C++, and the modules delve into topics like dynamic memory allocation, pointers, references, and memory leaks. Understanding memory management is essential for writing efficient and bug-free code.

4.Standard Template Library (STL): The STL is a powerful library in C++ that provides a collection of classes and functions for various common tasks, such as containers, algorithms, and iterators. Learning how to leverage the STL to write concise and efficient code.
